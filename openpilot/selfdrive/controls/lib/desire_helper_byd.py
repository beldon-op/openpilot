"""BYD desire/lane-change adaptation - the vendor port, kept out of the stock
DesireHelper. Selected in modeld via get_desire_helper(CP.brand).

Three stock hooks are overridden here:
  _update_clear_window / _clear_window_ok - the BSD rear-traffic clear window
    (sunnypilot 5d45f8f9c9). BSD_RADAR 0x418 (10 Hz) is the only rear-traffic
    input on the 宋 - the rear radar is unwired (0x374 has zero frames on every
    logged bus) - so a single-frame blindspot sample at the start edge is
    lag-prone and the stalk decodes a 0.2-0.3 s transient as a blinker. A
    change may only start after the same-side blindspot stayed continuously
    clear for LANE_CHANGE_CLEAR_TIME_MIN. Raw carstate matches selfdrived's
    laneChangeBlocked predicate; the 2 s side.bsd_hold stays the existing
    (separate, stronger) start-blocker.
  _mid_maneuver_abort - a fresh same-side BSD hit mid-starting falls back to
    preLaneChange KEEPING the direction: DESIRES[dir][pre] is Desire.none so
    the car centers, and selfdrived's preLaneChange+blindspot predicate raises
    laneChangeBlocked on the next frame. laneChangeFinishing is deliberately
    never aborted (swinging back across the line that late is worse than
    completing the maneuver).

Plus the vendor lane-change assist speed floor (sunnypilot 1b0713ac11 T2),
LaneChangeAssistSpeed MPH; default "20" = the vendor's
dp_lat_lane_change_assist_speed, 0 = assist-less. Read through get_int_param
(stale compiled .so raises UnknownKeyName, and the C++ get_int would report an
unset key as 0 = assist-less); the raw file under /data/params is the manual
provisioning path until params_pyx.so is rebuilt with the new key. =0 -> inf:
the off->pre gate can't fire, an in-progress preLaneChange bails to off, and
the bluetooth request gate is denied - the assist machine is fully off at any
speed, which is also the switch that arms the vendor's assist-less yield mode
(AssistLessLaneChange, controlsd/selfdrived side).

# BYD rear-traffic hardening (sunnypilot 5d45f8f9c9, docs/byd-lane-change.md
# §八): BSD_RADAR 0x418 (10 Hz) is the only rear-traffic input on this platform
# - the rear radar is unwired (0x374 has zero frames on every logged bus).
# Single-frame blindspot sampling cannot cover the BSD lag or the 0.2-0.3 s
# stalk transient, so starting requires this much continuous same-side
# blindspot clearance and a fresh hit mid-change aborts back to preLaneChange.

# BYD T8 forward gap gate (sunnypilot d94a1a8570, docs/byd-radar-010x.md
# §④e/§④f): CarState.radarGapClosing/radarGapNew from the bus1 0x109 b7
# boundary-cross monitor (radar_gap.py) as an extra upstream input to the
# clear window. Three levels via the BydRadarGapGate raw param (device
# default 0 = behavior byte-for-byte unchanged until the road test):
#   1 - while the gap is closing across its band, treat it like a blindspot
#       hit for the clear window: reopen it, and never start mid-alert.
#       (④e: b7 crossed the plateau midpoint before 309/309 gear flips, and
#        capture leads the HUD by >=10 s - the alert is EARLIER than anything
#        the HUD-gear path could ever see.)
#   2 - additionally abort laneChangeStarting on a NEW target that is closing:
#       radar-visible was false at the start edge and the cone swept in a
#       fast-closing car ahead. A target that was already visible before the
#       start does NOT abort - without yRel (b3 non-lateral, ⑦) we cannot tell
#       "target-lane car we are diving in front of" from "own-lane car we are
#       escaping", and swinging back across the line toward the latter is the
#       worse failure. laneChangeFinishing is never aborted (10-11 discipline).
#   3 - stage-3 lane discrimination (byd-radar-multitarget-port): the monitor
#       classifies the closing target by its slot-table yRel into own/adjacent
#       lane (relative bands + hysteresis, radar_gap.py; CarState publishes
#       radarGapLane). Adjacent-lane closings stop blocking the clear window
#       and stop aborting - they are telemetry only. Levels 1/2 ignore the
#       lane field entirely (byte-identical semantics, spec discipline), and
#       lane==UNKNOWN (slot table off / lateral fields 未定案 / NaN) degrades
#       to the exact level-2 conservative behavior with the monitor's
#       `degraded` counter ticking for the road test.
