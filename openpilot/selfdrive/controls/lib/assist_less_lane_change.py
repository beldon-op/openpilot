"""
Assist-less lane change - vendor port (op_byd "rick - assist-less lane change",
controlsd.py:691-703; design sunnypilot docs/byd-lane-change.md §四, ported
from sunnypilot 1b0713ac11 T3).

When LaneChangeAssistSpeed is 0 (turn-signal lane change assist disabled), a
blinker plus the driver holding the wheel in the same direction releases
lateral control entirely for the duration of the lane change: the driver steers
manually and openpilot never fights the EPS LKAS session mid-maneuver. The
state latches until BOTH blinkers are off. Sign convention note: BYD
SteerDriverTorque was measured left=positive on archived routes
(docs/byd-lane-change.md §四.1), same as openpilot, so the vendor's
torque-direction test is ported verbatim.

Carrot adaptation: sunnypilot refreshes the param from controlsd's
get_params_sp hook and selfdrived's params_thread; this fork has neither at
the same call sites, so the instance self-refreshes every 100 update() calls
(1 s at 100 Hz, the desire_helper precedent) - both the controlsd and the
selfdrived copy then behave identically without host wiring.
